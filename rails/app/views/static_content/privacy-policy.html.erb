<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>What This Policy Covers</h3>
<br />
<p>Chiive takes your privacy seriously.  This privacy policy (“the Policy”) governs how the Chiive service and website (collectively, the “Service”), found at www.chiive.com, collect and use information about you.  This Policy does not cover information that you provide to, or that is gathered by, companies that Chiive does not own or control, or to individuals that Chiive does not employ.  By registering for and using Chiive, you agree to the terms of the Policy. </p><br />

<h3>The Information We Collect and How We Use It </h3>
<br />

<p><u>Personal information you provide to us</u></p>
<p><br />
Personal information is information about you that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, email address, etc.  When you register for the Chiive service, we request your name, email address and location information.  You may also choose to provide us with additional information, such as age, gender, profile photograph, family, relationships, activities, interests, etc.  We use this information to allow you to invite friends to connect with you using Chiive, interact with other users of Chiive, improve Chiive’s content, customize the advertising and content you see, and communicate with you about the Chiive service.  By using the Service, you consent to Chiive’s use of your personal information for these purposes. </p>
<br />

<p><u>Information we collect automatically</u></p>
<p><br />
Chiive automatically collects and stores certain nonpersonal information when you interact with the Service.  Examples of nonpersonal information that Chiive collects include the identity of your web browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address, Chiive cookie information and the domain name of your Internet service provider.  Chiive also automatically collects information about site traffic, such as the number and frequency of visits to the site, the locations of users visiting the site, and clickstream data (such as the pages visited and time spent at each page)</p>
<br />
<p>Chiive aggregates this nonpersonal information to help us understand how our subscribers use the Site.  We use this aggregated information to evaluate site use, assess and improve site performance, and improve the content of the Site.  We do not combine this information with personal information to tell us who you are or what your contact information is. </p>
<p>Chiive also automatically collects information about your location in real time to help you find events created by your Chiive connections, and to help your Chiive connections find your events.  Photos are tagged with location permanently. Chiive does not track the user’s movements when not actively contributing content to the site. Chiive does, however, track and analyze location information on an aggregated basis, as described above, to assist us in analyzing subscribers’ needs and improving the Chiive service.  By using the Service, you consent to Chiive’s use of your nonpersonal information for these purposes. </p>
<br />
<p><u>Cookies</u></p>
<br />
<p>A cookie is a small text file that Chiive places on your computer’s hard drive which enable Chiive to recognize your computer.  Chiive’s cookies do not collect personal information. </p>
<p>Chiive’s advertising partners may place cookies on your hard drives to assist them in compiling information about you and delivering targeted advertising to you.  This Policy does not cover the use of cookies by advertisers. </p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to prevent cookies from being placed on your hard drive.  You can remove or block cookies using this feature in your browser, but doing so may prevent you from using some of Chiive’s features. </p>
<br />
<p><u>Children</u></p>
<br />
<p>Chiive does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. </p>


<br/><br/>
<h3>How Chiive Shares the Information it Collects</h3>
<br/>
<p>We use the information we collect from you to operate the Service, monitor and improve the Service, and provide you with customized advertising.  Chiive employs service providers to help with certain of these tasks, and shares some personal and nonpersonal information with these service providers to enable them to assist Chiive.  Chiive’s service providers have no right to use this information for any purpose other than assisting Chiive.  By your use of the Chiive service, you consent to Chiive’s disclosure of your personal and nonpersonal information to these service providers. </p>
<br/>
<p>Chiive may disclose personal information in special situations where Chiive has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring or interfering with Chiive’s rights.  Chiive may disclose personal information we receive in connection with a notification of copyright infringement (or corresponding counter-notification) to the parties to the dispute, as described more fully in Chiive’s Copyright Policy.  Chiive may also reveal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, such as in response to a subpoena or court order.   Chiive may reveal personal information if we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect Chiive and you from people violating Chiive’s Terms of Service.  This may include sharing information with other entities, attorneys, courts or other government entities. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Using the Chiive Service to Share Your Information</h3>
<br/>
<p>Chiive is designed to allow you to share information with others.  You can control what information you share through your privacy settings.  You may choose to make your information available to (1) only your friends and the friends of your friends; or (2) the public at large.  Privacy settings are controlled by the creator of an event. By joining the event you agree to the privacy settings of that event.  To manage your privacy settings, the creator of an event can select the desired privacy level in the event settings.  Information that you provide to Chiive will be available to those users whom you allow to access your information, so please do not include any confidential information that you do not wish to be shared.  If you do not wish to share the metadata associated with your photographs, please remove the metadata before uploading your photographs to the Service. </p>
<br/>
<p> Your default username on the Service is your first name and the first initial of your last name (i.e., John Doe’s default username is John D.).  Your first name and last initial will be publicly available in search results, both on Chiive and via third-party search engines.  This is so that your friends will be able to find you and connect to you on  Chiive.  When your name appears in a search result, however, people will not be able to access your information unless they connect to you in a way that allows access based on your privacy settings (such as by becoming a friend). </p>
<br/>
<p>When you invite someone to connect to you using the Service, the invitation will include your full name, to ensure that the person being invited knows who has sent the invitation. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Links to Third-Party Websites</h3>
<br/>
<p>The Service may provide links to third-party websites that Chiive does not own or control.  Chiive is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these third-party websites, and this Policy does not cover any information you exchange with any third-party websites.  You should carefully review the privacy policy of any website you visit.  Chiive’s inclusion of such links does not imply any endorsement of the material on such sites or of their owners or operators. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Security</h3>
<br/>
<p>Chiive takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to subscribers’ information.  Chiive regularly reviews its data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to ensure the protection of personal information. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Consent to Collection and Processing of Information in the United States</h3>
<p>By using Chiive, you consent to having the information described in the Policy transferred to and processed in the United States, regardless of where you live. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3>Sale of Assets or Change of Control</h3>
<p>If Chiive sells all or substantially all of its assets, or in the unlikely event that Chiive seeks bankruptcy protection, Chiive may transfer your personal information to the new owner or other third party so that the Service may continue to operate.  You consent to any such transfer and to the continued use of your personal information subject to the terms of this Policy. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Use of Backup Media</h3>
<br/>
<p>Chiive employs backup media to ensure the preservation of information in the event of server failure or other catastrophe.  If you delete information from your account, this information may remain on backup media for a limited period of time. </p>
<br/>
<h3>How to Review and Change Your Personal Information</h3>
<br/>
<p>The web and mobile applications of the Service include a “settings” or “account settings” screen in which to view and update your personal information.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Deleting Your Account</h3>
<br/>
<p>You may delete your account if you no longer wish to use the Service.  By deleting an account all content related to that user will be deleted immediately.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<br/>
<p>Chiive may revise this Policy from time to time.  We will post a copy of the policy as modified on the Chiive site, and notify subscribers if significant changes have been made.  We recommend that you check the Policy periodically to determine whether it has been modified.</p>
