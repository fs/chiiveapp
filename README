Overview
-------------------------------------------------
Chiive is a social photo sharing service.  Users can create events or join other users's events.
Within an event users can add photos and comment on photos already there.


-------------------------------------------------
Rails Application Data Model
-------------------------------------------------
Primary Objects:
User: a Chiive user
Post: a photo
PersonalSet: A group of photos from one user
SocialSet: An event, which is a group of PersonalSets from different users.

Users create and own Posts (photo), Posts are grouped into PersonalSets, and PersonalSets are 
grouped into SocialSets to create an event.  An event with one attendee is a SocialSet that contains
a single PersonalSet.  When a users create Events, they are creating a PersonalSet to hold their
photos, and a SocialSet that acts as the Event, which other Users can join by adding their
PersonalSets to the SocialSet.

Once a User has created a SocialSet, other Users nearby, around the same time, will see the
Event as a Suggested Event, inviting these other Users to join and contribute Posts.  When joining an
Event, a PersonalSet is created for that User, belonging to the overall SocialSet.

When two users each have a PeronalSet belonging to the same SocialSet, the photos for each 
PersonalSet appear grouped together to both users. The owners of PersonalSets are displayed as 
"Attendees" of the Event they belong to.

In addition to creating Posts and SocialSets, users may add Comments to SocialSets or Posts,
and create Frienships with other users.


-------------------------------------------------
Chiive Time and Position Tracking
-------------------------------------------------
Chiive relies on the time and location of Posts, PersonalSets, and SocialSets to suggest
nearby SocialSets to Users.

Posts, PersonalSets, and SocialSets are each tagged with a time, latitude and longitude. 
When a Post is added to a PersonalSet, the PersonalSet's time and location are incrementally updated.
When a PersonalSet's time and location change, the parent SocialSet's time and location are
incrementally updated.


-------------------------------------------------
Server Setup
-------------------------------------------------
Chiive is hosted on Amazon EC2, and deployed with capistrano and the experimental branch of ec2onrails.
The experimental branch of ec2onrails can be installed from github.com/pauldowman/ec2onrails using:

gem install ec2onrails-experimental

With the ec2onrails and the public/private keys in place locally, deploy with the standard “cap deploy:migrations”.
Post photos and user avatars are all hosted on Amazon S3, using Thoughtbot's Paperclip gem.
