			<h3>Chiive Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>Chiive&#8217;s Customer Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by Apple anytime you interact with Chiive, such as when you visit our website, when you purchase Chiive products and services, or when you call our sales or support associates. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at Chiive, and we go to great lengths to protect it.</p>
			<h4>Why we collect personal information</h4>
			<p>We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.</p>
			<p>If you do not want Chiive to keep you up to date with Chiive news, software updates and the latest information on products and services click www.apple.com/contact/myinfo and update your personal contact information and preferences.</p>
			<h4>What information we collect and how we may use it</h4>
			<p>There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We may ask for your personal information when you&#8217;re discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate, downloading a software update, registering for a seminar, participating in an online survey, registering your products, or purchasing a product.</li>
				<li>When you interact with Chiive, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information and information about the Chiive products you own, such as their serial numbers and date of purchase; and information relating to a support or service issue.</li>
				<li>We also collect information for market research purposes &#8212; such as your occupation and where you use your computer &#8212; to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service.</li>
				<li>We collect information regarding customer activities on our website. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites, products, and Internet services are of most interest to them.</li>

			<h4>Your Chiive ID and related information</h4>
			<p>The Chiive website, as well as Chiive services, allows you to create an Chiive ID&#8221; based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services. Here&#8217;s how it works: You create a personal profile &#8212; providing your name, phone number, email address, and in some cases your mailing address or a credit card number &#8212; and choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Chiive ID &#8212; in many cases simply your email address, because it&#8217;s unique and easy to remember. The next time you order from the Apple Store or register a new product, all you need to do is enter your Chiive ID and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the information associated with your Chiive ID it will be available for all your transactions with for all your transactions with Chiive globally.</p>
